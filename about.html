                Taj McGraw Studios is an all-analog home studio located in north
                Seattle. We make radio-ready professional recordings for any
                format including iTunes, CD, LP, and cassette.
              </p>

                  >Toft ATB 16</a
                >, an analog board based on classic Trident Studios mixing
                consoles. A wide variety of tube amps, microphones, and classic
                outboard gear also allow for a range of tone for your project,
                along with an upright grand piano, Hammond organ, and a
                selection of guitars.
              </p>
              <p>
                Songs are recorded on one-inch 16 track and mixed down to
                quarter-inch two track. Final stereo recordings are then
                digitized via Pro Tools and can be uploaded instantly to the
                master house of your choice, along with providing you MP3 and
                WAV files.

          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <h3>Come in around 11 and have a song around 7...</h3>
          <p>
            Taj McGraw Studios is available on weekends for full days of
            recording. The preference is that one song is done per day, with
            rhythm tracks (drums, bass, guitars) laid down first, then vocals,
            percussion, and other sounds second. This insures a great ‘live’
            feel to the recording and makes your song sound more natural and
            organic.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the tracks are done, a draft mix will be completed. Schedule
            time for the band to come in for a mixing session and complete the
            song. It’s best for the band to participate so everyone is on the
            same page and everyone gets what they want out of the overall sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, draft MP3s are completed and distributed. If there are
            additional changes, more mixing (within reason!) can be scheduled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rates are very good, so feel free to contact me at
            <span class="about-email"></span> for a quote.

          <h2>More Options</h2>
          <p>
            If your band just wants to record at Taj McGraw and mix elsewhere,
            you can bring a thumb drive to extract the tracks from tape onto
            digital, via JoeCo analog to digital converter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, if you have a stereo recording that you would like to give
            more boost and analog treatment before mastering, we can run your
            songs through a number of options from tape to Hammer EQ and Manley
            ELOP outboard gear, along with a Burl B2 for final digital
            conversion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rates vary per project based on number of songs, original format,
            and equipment desired.
