                <p class="about">Taj McGraw Studios is a fully-functional all-analog home studio able to
                    make professional recordings ready for radio play, iTunes, digital, CD, LP, and cassette formats.  A wide variety of tube amps, microphones, and outboard gear allow for a diversity of tone in your project, while being captured on one-inch 16 track format and mixed down to quarter-inch two track.  Master recordings are then digitized via Pro Tools, and can be uploaded instantly to the master house of your choice.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <h3>"Come in around 11 and have a song around 7..."</h3>
                <p>Taj McGraw Studios is available on weekends for full days of recording.  The preference is that one song is done per day, so it is best that your band have a solid idea of what the song is and how it goes.  Rhythm tracks (drums, bass, guitars) are laid down first, then vocals, percussion, and other flavors second.  This insures a great ‘live’ feel to the recording and makes your song sound more natural and organic.  Rates for this are $200 a day.  If any further overdubs are necessary, time can be made during the evenings, Monday through Friday for a quick session.</p>
                <p>After the tracks are done, a draft mix will be completed.  Schedule time for the band to come in for a mixing session and complete the song.  It’s best for the band to participate so everyone is on the same page and everyone gets what they want out of the overall sound.  Mixing sessions are $100, and generally take place on weekends.  From there, draft MP3s are completed and distributed.  If there are additional changes, more mixing (within reason!) can be scheduled at no additional cost.</p>

                <h2>Options</h2>
                <p>If your band just wants to record at Taj McGraw and mix elsewhere, the day rate is the same, just can bring a thumb drive to extract the tracks from tape onto digital.</p>
                <p>If you have a stereo recording you would like to put onto tape for analog treatment, which includes Hammer EQ and Manley ELOP outboard gear, that service runs $100.  For another $20, you get the tape.</p>
